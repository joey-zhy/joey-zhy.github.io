abstract: Using coaxial shielding gas for low-oxygen protection in metal droplet-based 3D printing helps to promote flexible production and lightweight manufacturing. However, the presence of the printing substrate causes the shielding gas to exhibit complex annular impinging jet characteristics, making the stability of droplet ejection unpredictable. In the present work, the mechanisms of airflow pattern evolution on droplet formation and metal jet deflection were first revealed by incorporating shielding gas simulations, hydrodynamic modeling, and droplet ejection experiments. An innovative airflow disturbance suppression strategy for metal droplet ejection was proposed, which can remarkably reduce the shielding gas disturbance on droplet printing. Results show that the change in deposition distance leads to a transition between two typical airflow patterns, thus affecting the droplet ejection behavior. When the deposition distance exceeds 2.5 mm, metal jets would be stretched even to a secondary break under airflow pattern 1, accelerating droplets. For the deposition distance below 2.5 mm, metal jet shortening and droplet deceleration would occur under airflow pattern 2, deflecting jet trajectory. The negative airflow effect on droplet ejection could be avoided by controlling the deposition distance to the transition region of two airflow patterns. Furthermore, a ball grid array (BGA) chip ball-mounting and two thin-wall tube printing were realized based on metal droplet ejection in annular impinging jet shielding gas. This work provides theoretical and technical guidance for the stable ejection and accurate printing of metal droplets in an opening low-oxygen environment.
