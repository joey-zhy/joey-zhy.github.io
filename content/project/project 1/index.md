Project Time: 2018-09 ~ 2019-07\
Research objectives: The Project proposes the research and development of metal droplet ejection 3D printing equipment for microelectronic circuit/chip manufacturing and packaging. Develop piezoelectric metal droplet ejection device and its control system. Establish desktop metal droplet 3D printing equipment. Theoretically, study the mechanism of stress wave transmission, metal jet breakup, and droplet formation inside the nozzle, match material properties with ejection parameters, obtain the key droplet ejection process parameters by using numerical analysis and experiments, and realize the on-demand ejection and precise positioning of metal droplets in different temperature zones. Additional, study the matching law of metal droplet ejection and deposition parameters in a wide temperature range. analyze the bonding strength and fusion mechanism between metal droplets and substrate, realize the controlled deposition of metal droplets on different substrates, obtain the printing method of flexible microelectronic circuits and high-precision solder ball arrays. Eventually, provide a new and original 3D printing technology for the sustainable development of 3D printing industry in Shaanxi province.
