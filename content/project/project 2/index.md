title: Micro-domain shielding gas system and experimental research of solder ball printing for 5G circuits (Innovation and Creativity Seed Fund for Master Students)
summary: |2-
   * Responsible for the overall program design of the project. Based on the existing tin alloy ejection crucible components, combined with the equipment structure, designed an integrated opening  metal droplet-based ejection coaxial shielding gas system.
   * Simulation and experiment research. Different shapes of shielding gas flow field were studied with commercial simulation software such as Fluent. The simulation results were verified by experiments.

Research objectives:\
Focusing on the problem that the existing ball grid array preparation technology cannot meet the future demand for mass manufacturing of 5G communication circuit bumps, we propose a new idea of uniform metal droplet on-demand ejection technology for 5G bump printing in an opening environment. The aim is to develop a controllable metal droplets ejection coaxial shielding gas system for 5G circuit bump printing. Study the effect of coaxial shielding gas on potential adverse factors such as the Karman vortex effect during high-speed flight of metal droplets. Achieve stable and controllable ejection of metal droplets and bump printing in an opening environment, laying the foundation for the industrial promotion and application of uniform metal droplet ejection technology in the field of high-frequency circuit packaging.
