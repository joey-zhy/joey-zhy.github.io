abstract: The invention provides a metal droplet jetting device with a small backflow area, which solves the technical problems that a side-blowing type protective airflow generating assembly in the existing metal droplet jetting device has strong interference effect on the jetting flight process of metal droplets, and the existing annular jet type protective airflow generating assembly has a larger backflow area. The device's protection gas runner comprises protection gas equipartition section runner and protection gas effect section runner, and protection gas effect section runner comprises annular jet district I and side-blown district II, and the protection gas is the gas homogenizing effect through protection gas equipartition section runner earlier, and the second flow makes protection gas flow direction unanimous with the liquid drop whereabouts direction through protection gas effect section runner annular jet district I, and the low-angle aggregation effect that passes through protection gas effect section runner side-blown district II finally reaches near the nozzle to be used for the low oxygen protection of metal liquid drop.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: metal droplet, micro backflow domain, shielding gas.
