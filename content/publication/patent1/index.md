abstract: The invention relates to a uniform micro-droplet/polymer space circuit combined printing device and a method, belonging to the field of rapid printing of three-dimensional circuits; the device comprises an anti-oxidation inert gas cylinder, a pressure reducing valve, a glove box, an oxygen content detector, a water content detector, a high molecular polymer printing assembly, a uniform metal droplet jetting assembly, a signal generator, a laser, a temperature controller, a motion control card, a three-dimensional moving platform and a hot bed; the anti-oxidation inert gas cylinder is communicated with the glove box through a pressure reducing valve, the three-dimensional moving platform is fixed on the bottom surface of an inner cabin of the glove box, and the hot bed is fixed on the upper surface of the three-dimensional moving platform; the high molecular polymer printing component, the uniform metal droplet jetting component and the laser are fixed at the top of the inner chamber of the glove box through the cantilever beam, and the laser re-melts the metal circuit deposited and solidified on the hot bed after receiving the control signal; the invention solves the problems that air is easy to remain and pores are easy to form when silver paste is used for circuit printing, thereby improving the circuit forming quality and the electrical conductivity.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Uniform droplet, polymer, space circuit.
